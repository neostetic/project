### Information
 - This game is made for <a href="">School Project</a>.
 - The idea was, to make a 60 seconds clone, without <b>3D elements</b>, like walking around and collecting stuff.
 - The game is somewhat self-explanatory, I tried to do element as easy to follow, as I could without any tutorial whatsoever - if you get lost, than have a look to <a href="#help-and-tutorial">help section</a>.
 - The game also is luck based, so choose your difficulty, that suits you well. 
<br><br>

### Goal of the Game
 - Your goal is to survive for as long as possible, that means this game is practically endless.
 - Every day you will get objective to complete that you don't need to complete.
<br><br>

### Tips and Tricks
 - If you hover over Soup 'n' Water box, you can see how many Water and Food you have. The character eats and drinks based on difficulty.
 - Also look at your character from time to time, if he will get sick, he will look sad. Events will be harder to be successful (for example, having worse luck).
 - If you don't have Food or Water, your health will slowly drown. And don't get scarred if your Water or Food will sometimes be used by the player!
